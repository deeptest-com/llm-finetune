1 Introduction
After fusion welding, two separate parts are joined by the
melting and subsequent solidification of adjacent areas. Heat
flow during welding not only controls the size of the fusion,
but also affects the properties of the weldment. The tem-
perature distribution within weldment plays an important
called bead [3]. In order to utilize these principles, some
means of controlling the power (voltage and current) is
essential. However, the voltage is governed by the arc length
which in turn depends on the electrode diameter. The
selection of current and voltage is according to the size of the
work piece and the position to be welded.
The quality of weld is determined by weld bead geometry
parameters which depend on the input process parameters.
Therefore, choosing an appropriate set of welding parame-
ters becomes one of the most important tasks in welding
process. Tham et al. [4] investigated the correlation between
welding parameters (arc voltage, welding current and
welding speed) and bead geometry of 3F fillet joint welded in
downhill position by GMAW. The consumable was ER70S-
6 1.2 mm solid wire and shielded by carbon dioxide. Artic-
ulated welding robot performed a welding of 6 mm carbon
steel T-joint. Mathematical models and calculator were
developed to display the values of weld bead geometry for

weld pool geometry and the dimensions calculated from a
angle, and the output process parameters were weld bead
width, reinforcement and depth of penetration. The material
used for experiment was 316L (N) of 8 mm thickness, and
the fller wire was in same grade of 1.2 mm diameter. The
results were fed to the ANN algorithm for establishing a
relationship between the input and the output parameters.
The results were then embedded into the PSO algorithm
which optimized the process parameters. Rao et al. [7] used
Taguchi experimental design to develop the mathematical
models that correlated welding process parameters to weld
bead geometry with experimental investigation using
regression analysis. Five process parameters such as wire
the form of 60 mm wide bar. Ganjigatti et al. [9] employed
base material. Three linear regression analysis approaches
and one non-linear regression analysis approach were
weldment of aluminum foam plates of 10 mm thickness.
Eight selected control factors were: type of filler material,
the welding strength predicted by the ANN model was better
than that based on PSO used by MRA. Malviya and Pratihar
[12] cartied out both forward and reverse mappings of MIG
welding process by tuning in the neural networks. The chosen
input parameters were welding speed, welding voltage, wire
feed rate, gas flow rate, nozzle-to-plate distance, torch angle,
and the responses were Hg, Wg and Pg. A mild steel plate of
8 mm thickness was used. Four approaches were developed
and their performances were compared. In addition, literatures
review on the application of experiment design, evolutionary
algorithm and computational networks had been made by
It is observed from the literatures that previously
reseatchers used different input process parameters like
open circuit voltage, welding current, wire feed rate,
welding speed, nozzle-to-plate distance, work piece thick-
ness, pulse frequency, gas flow rate, torch angle, etc., and
investigation on effects of welding process parameters on
AISI321 steel is thus very essential. In order to obtain good
weld bead, proper input welding process parameters should
be selected to optimize the economics of the welding
models for bead geometry parameters and investigates the
effects of input process parameters of GMAW process on
bead geometry, mechanical properties such as hardness and
microstructures in various zones of the weldment. In

out.
2 Methodology
2.1 GMAW machine
The experiments are carried out on a 3-phase, 50 Hz fre-
quency, 300 A, forced air cooling semiautomatic machine
manufactured by ATE, Pune, India. The torch is fixed to the
frame at 90° to the work piece. The work piece on trolley
moves in perfect path and the gas flow rate, wire feed rate,
welding voltage are adjusted on the machine. The variation in
the voltage automatically changes the current. Hence, current
is not considered as an input parameter in the experiments.
Therefore, four input process parameters, viz: welding volt-
age, wire feed rate, gas flow rate and welding speed have
infuence on the weld bead geometry, hardness and micro-
structure. Figure 1 shows the GMAW machine setup.
2.2 AISI321 grade steel and sample preparation
The AISI321 is a stabilized austenite stainless steel which
is similar to AISI304, however the content of titanium is
five times the carbon, which reduces or prevents carbide
precipitation during welding. It has excellent resistance to
oxidation and corrosion, at the same time possesses good

2.3 Selection of process parameter and design matrix
Process parameters play a very important role in deter-
mining good weld bead geometry [14]. Therefore, proper
selection of welding parameters is required. Different
welding parameters to be selected are welding voltage,
welding speed, wire feed rate, gas fow rate, and the output
responses are Hg, Wg and Py. Moreover, the weld bead
geometry will influence the mechanical properties of the
weldment. Therefore, mechanical properties such as hard-
ness are also considered as an output parameter. The input
and output process parameters are given in Fig. 3.
The four process parameters are at five levels. These
controllable process parameters are identified based on
their effects on weld bead geometry and good appearance
of the weld bead. It is desirable to have five minimum
levels of process parameters to refect the true behavior of
response parameters. The working range of each process
parameter is chosen by taking various trials for a smooth

3.1.3 Effect of process parameters on Py
It is found from Fig. 8 that Pp is indirectly proportional to
S and directly proportional to V, G and F. Pg decreases
with the increase in welding speed because the time during
which the arc force is allowed to penetrate into the mate-
rial’s surface decreases. Pg increases with the increase in
G which fills the material into the weld bead groove and
gives more penetration inside the groove. Increase in V and
F will deposit more molten metal inside the groove and
will increase the Pg.
3.1.4 Effect of process parameters on hardness
Vickers hardness tests are conducted at different zones of
the weldment as per ASTM E 384 standards. These include
weld zone, heat affected zone (HAZ) and base metal. The
average values are calculated and given in Table 4. The
average values obtained using Vickers hardness test after
experimental are in the range of standard values of the
hardness of the AISI 321 steel.
From Fig. 9 it is observed that with the increases in V, F,
G and the value of hardness increases. Hardness decreases
with the increasing of 3. The hardness in weld zone and
HAZ is due to over precipitation and increased carbon
hardness decreases at a distance away from HAZ.
3.2 Joint effects of input process parameters
3.2.1 Joint effect of wire feed rate and gas flow rate on Hg
Figure 10 shows the joint effect of F and G on Hg. It is
depicted in Fig. 10, which shows that Hy decreases with
increase in F and decrease in G.
3.2.2 Joint effect of welding speed and gas flow rate on Pg
Figure 11 shows the joint effect of 5 and G on Pg. It is
observed that Pg increases slightly with the increase in gas
flow rate for all levels of welding speed but it is also evi-
dent that Pp slightly decreases with the increase in welding
speed for all levels of gas fow rate.
3.2.3 Joint effect of welding speed and voltage on Py
Figure 12 shows the joint effect of S and V on Pg. It is clear
from Fig. 12 that Pg remains the same with the increase in

welded zone and temperature is distributed along
the length of the weldment in conduction. The
convection takes place in the middle part of the
weldment.
