1 Introduction
The high resolution bathymetry model is needed for re-
searching on ocean geophysics, biology, and climate
science, but ship soundings still cover the ocean
sparsely even after decades of years of surveying. It will
be very difficult to create a 1 minute bathymetry model
just relying on ship soundings in the near future. The
technological advance of satellite altimetry provides a
new approach to high resolution bathymetry model con-
struction. Dixon et allll showed that bathymetry of the
ocean can be predicted from altimetry data. The follow-
ing studies show that altimetric gravity anomalies can
be used to predict bathymetry at the waveband 20-200
km"**. Smith and Sandwell'?! developed a method to
construct a high resolution bathymetry model from ship
soundings and altimetric gravity anomalies. According

to S&S method, the long wavelengths ( >200 km) ba-
thymetry models were constrained by ship soundings ,
and bathymetry of shorter wavelengths (20-200 km)
was predicted from gravity anomalies.
At present, nearly all the high resolution global ba-
thymetry models were constructed from ship soundings
and satellite altimetry gravity anomalies. The bathyme-
try model will depend on gravity anomalies at the wave-
band 20-200 km ,and must be careful when analyzing
the isostatic mechanism of sea floor with these models
and gravity anomalies. Wang!" pointed out that this
problem of depending can be avoided if the bathymetry
model can be predicted from vertical gravity gradient a-
nomalies《 VGGC) and derives equations used to finish
the work in the space domain. The method of Wang was
not implemented because of low signal-to-noise ratio of
VGG. Wu et al'? constructed a 2 minute bathymetry
model in the South China Sea with VGG and ship
soundings, but its accuracy is lower than ETOPO2. Hu
et al’ studied this issue using simulated data.
In this paper,a 1 minute bathymetry model is con-
structed using ship soundings and VGG in a 2X2 de-
gree region in the northwest Pacific. The ship sound-
ings are obtained from National Geophysics Data Center
( NGDC ) ,and used to establish long wavelength
(>200 km) bathymetry. The VGG is downloaded from
SIO ( Scripps Institute of Oceanography ) , UCSD,
V20.1, and used to predict bathymetry at the wave-
band 20-200 km. The model accuracy is evaluated by
comparing the result with ship soundings and the exist-
ing models, and the result can show that a high resolu-
tion and accuracy bathymetry model can be predicted
from VGG and ship soundings.
2 Method
Parker!" derived an equation which can be used to
calculate gravity anomalies from seafloor undulations.
Based on the derivative theorem of Fourier Transform
and formula (4) in Parker「s paper, we generate the e-
quation for calculating VGG from seafloor undulations
directly;
AG(k)=
where,〖=2m/A is the wave number, A is the wave-
length, AG,(k) is the Fourier Transform of VGG, G is
the gravitational constant, p, is the density of seafloor
crust, p, is the density of sea water, d is the mean wa-
ter depth, H(k) is the Fourier Transform of seafloor
undulations, h(x) is the seafloor undulations in space
domain, Fis the symbol of Fourier Transform. There is
no isostatic effect in equation (1), which will be used
at the waveband 20-200 km. If we take into account
the upward continuation of ocean depth, the equation
(1) can be simplified to:
The admittance function between seafloor undula-
tions and VGG is:
We use VGG to predict bathymetry at the waveband
20-200 km, therefore:
According to equation (4), after downward continu-
ation and divided by 〖 ,the relationship between
AG_(k) and H(k) will be linear. Due to inhomogeneity
of seafloor density, the linear coefficient will be com-
puted from ship soundings and VGG.
The predicted model will be the sum of the long
wavelength model from ship soundings and residual ba-
thymetry predicted from VGG. That means :
where, h(x) is the predicted result, h,, (x) can
be gotten by low-pass filter of grids from ship sound-
ings, and hvcc( %)》 is predicted from VGG.
The data processing procedure can be illustrated by
figure 1. According to figure 1, firstly, ship soundings
were processed to form grids and which are then fil-
tered by 200 km low-pass Gaussian filter to establish
Bios ( 5 ).、SecondIy,residual depths on ship tracks
(Russidua《 「 ) should be prepared for calculating S
(x'). The reference depths of ship points are interpolated
from hy, (x), and then being subbed from the ob-
served depth to get h(x"). VGG are filtered by 20
-200 km band-pass Gaussian filter. The filtered VGG
are then downward continued to mean depth and divi-
sion by k for bathymetry prediction (VGG_BP). VGG
on ship points are interpolated from VGG_BP and then
are used to calculate. That is
where, S(x") is the depth-to-VGG ratios on ship
points, x’ is the location of ship soundings. Then we
can calculate the bathymetry model by:
where, S(x) is girding from residual depth-to-VGG ra-
tios on ship points.
3 Data and result
3.1 Data
The experimental area is 20? ―-22°N, 156° - 158° EK
from the northwest Pacific. Ship soundings are down-
loaded from NGDC, including 9058 points of data
(Fig.2). The ship soundings cover an area of 3x3 de-
gree in order to eliminate the boundary effect. About
95% of ship soundings were used to construct bathyme-
try model and 5% were used to evaluate the model ac-
curacy. The COE ( Cross Over Errors) of the ship
tracks were assessed with x2svs in GMT. The mean and
STD of COE are about -8. 9 m and 70. 5 respectively.
The ship soundings cover sparsely in the 2X2 degree
studied area, only about 16% of the grids can be deter-
mined by ship soundings directly, and its resolution is
very difficult to assess because of the unevenly cover of
the tracks.

are showed in table 1.
The coherency between seafloor topography and VGG
in the northwest Pacific is showed in figure 4.
According to figure 4 the coherency is very high at
the waveband 20-200 km. This means that bathymetry
prediction from VGG is reasonable.
