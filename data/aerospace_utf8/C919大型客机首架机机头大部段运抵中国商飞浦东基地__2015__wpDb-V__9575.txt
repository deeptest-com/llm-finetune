1 Introduction
GOCE satellite with the first combination of satellite
gravity gradiometry ( SGG) and satellite-to-satellite
tracking (SST) technique has been launched success-
fully on March 17, 2009. Great improvements have
been achieved in the field of geophysics, ,geodynamics ,
geodesy and so on since GOCE started tp provide high-
precision and high-resolution gravity field informa-
tion!" =", Currently, there are three methods to deter-
mine earth gravity field by SST: integral method
(IM), acceleration method (AM) and energy conser-
vation method ( ECM). Satellite acceleration can be
derived either from its position or from its velocity.
Studies show that the accuracy and reliability of

acceleration derived from velocity is better than those
from I)0siti0Il〔乏署〕 . However, the precondition of the a-
bove conclusion is that the orbit data includes both po-
sition and velocity. Therefore, acceleration determina-
tion from velocity is easily realized by using dynamic
orbit (DO) or reduced-dynamic orbit (RDO) but hard
for kinematic orbit ( KO). Moreover, prior gravity
field model used in dynamic or reduced-dynamic orbit
determination inevitably influences the gravity field re-
covery when DO or RDO is used. The best way is to
use KO for gravity field recovery since there is not any
prior gravity field model included in KO?'. A Cheby-
shev fitting method with redundant observations
(CRO) is proposed and it can reach a 3D precision of
0.3 mm/s!"'. Tt still can’t meet the requirement of
high-precision gravity field recovery.
In order to improve the interpolation accuracy, the
authors study the direct proportion relationship between
velocity error and orbit coordinates, and then propose a
remove and restore method ( RRM) since it can im-
prove the stability of values and the interpolation preci-
sion. In addition, KO obviously has some outliers. In
order to clear away the outliers ,an outliers detection
method (ODM) is proposed. Synthesizing the advanta-
and it can reach the highest precision compared to the
primary two methods. In this paper, we use some ex-
then expound its advantages.
2 Principle of the new algorithm
2.1 Principle of CRO
In order to calculate the Chebyshev polynomial coeffi-
cients, firstly fitting period must be transformed into
section [ - 1,1]. Transformational formula can be
shown as:
where 1, is the starting epoch and At is the sampling in-
terval. Then the Chebyshev recursion formula can be
defined as:
To(7) = 1
(7) =277.(7) -T, (1) n=12,
The size of coefficient matrix B is m x (n +1), in
which m is the number of sampling points. In general

1). However, the number of sampling points m in CRO
method should be greater than n + 1 (m>n+1).
Then the column vector L = (X;, , 友 , 友 , can be
error equation 1s:
V=BC-L (4)
where C is the n + 1 coefficient of Chebyshev polyno-
mial. The coefficient matrix C can be calculated hy
least squares:
2.2 Principle of RRM
increment between KO and reference orbit can be cal-
culated :
where Pko is the KO position, P ; 1s the position of
RDO, AP is the position increment.
Velocity increment can be interpolated by CRO when
the orbit increment is used as observation.
where AP, is the Chebyshev fitting polynomial, AV is
the velocity increment which is derived from position
ity increment to reference velocity-
where V_ is the velocity of RDO, Vy, is the final ve-
locity of KO.
However, the basic of RRM method is that both or-
is transformed into the same as KO.
2.3 Principle of ODM
The procedures of ODM method are as follows:
The KO RMS (s) is calculated by

4 Conclusion
The precision of velocity determination using CRO
method can not meet the requirement of high-precision
gravity field recovery. Taking the advantages of RRM
method and ODM method , CRROD method carn reach
a 3D precision of 0. 1 mm/s for GOCE satellite velocity
interpolation, which is above 3 times better than the
that of CRO method and far better than those of con-
ventional interpolation methods. The further investiga-
tion will focus on the gravity field recovery using ECM
based on the high-precision velocity information by the
proposed method.
