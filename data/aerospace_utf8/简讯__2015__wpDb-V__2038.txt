Most experiments on the direct fluorination
have focused on the performances of the adhe-
sion, gas separation, and chemical resistance
properties[2L2],、 However, relatively less atten-
tion, as well as experiments in detail, has been
paid to oleophobic and hydrophobic properties,

properties can afford the self-cleaning ability of
the surface of polymers, combination of oleopho-

materials[2251、In order to research the oleopho-
bic and hydrophobic properties of the surface per-
formances of direct fluorinated HDPE, Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR), scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and contact angle (CA) are
applied in the study. At the same time, a series
of oil and water-retard experiments are per-
formed.
1 EXPERIMENT
1.1 Materials and preparations
The matrix material used in this experiment
is HDPE with density of 0. 955 g/cmy and an melt
flow index (MFI) of 0.35 g/10 min (190 °C/
2.16 kg), obtained from Shanghai Golden Phil-
lips Petrochemical Co. Ltd.
Surface fluorination of HDPE sheets of
50 mm X50 mm X 1 mm size is performed in our
laboratory. Fluorination is carried out in closed
vessels at a total mixture pressure of 95. 8 kPa by
treating with mixture (F, + N;). Different fluori-
nation time (1 and 2 h) and different fluorination
concentration (1% and 2%) are applied to the
HDPE sheets to investigate an effect of extent of
fluorination on their surface properties. Fluorina-
ted HDPE sheets are stored in a silicagel desicca-
tor at room temperature.
1.2 FT-IR study
For structure analysis, FT-IR of the virgin
and fluorinated HDPE are studied using a spec-
trometer THERMO NICOLET 5700. The IR-
spectrum is recorded by transmission in a dry air
atmosphere between 4 000—400 cm?' with 64
spectral accumulations.
1.3 SEM observation and contact angle measure-
ments
The micro-structural characteristics are car-
ried out with a Jeol JSM-5800LV SEM. Contact
angels are measured with measuring system
JC2000C1. Measurements are performed by a ses-
sile drop method using the drop shape analyzer
(°) at room temperature (20 土 °C) and aver-
aged. Distilled water droplet is dropped to the
sample surface from a distance of 5 mm by the vi-
brating injector. The diameter of the droplet is
about 1 ecm. The contact angles of water are
measured to observe the ability of water-repellen-
cy on the direct fluorinated HDPE surface.
1.4 Mass varying measurements
The mass measurement experiments are Op-
erated in a thermostatic tank at 90 °C, where the
temperature is controlled within 土 0. 5 °C throughout
a run except for an initial fluctuation. Increment
of mass and time are recorded over a period from
1 d to 10 d. Fluorinated and un-fluorinated HDPE
sheets with the same amount are each immersed
in four cleaned and pre-weighed glass cups. The
first and the second cups (referred to as Sample 1
and Sample 2 are filled with distilled water,
to as Sample 3 and Sample 4) are filled with jet
fuel. Table 2 gives selected properties for the jet
fuel.

Mass varying experiments are measured
using an electronic balance (Shimadzu UX4200S)
with an accuracy of 0. 1 mg. Temperatures at the
experiment location are closed to 20 °C, and there
are no velocities over the surface of jet fuel.
2 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
2.1 Surface performance of direct fluorinated
HDPE hollow sphere
FT-IR spectra of the virgin and fluorinated
HDPE films are shown in Figs. 1,2.
Fig. 1 shows four typical bands of the virgin
HDPE, where 2 916 cm?' is due to —CH, dis-
symmetry stretching vibration, 2 850 cm?' is

719 cm! is the —CH, rocking vibration.
In the case of fluorinated HDPE, a broad
peak appears at 1 200 ecm?' in Fig. 2, which is
due to the absorption of C—F bond. According to
the literature, the frequency at 1000—1 300 cm?"
is a characteristic frequency of the C—F bond.
Kharitonov, et allz?) observed that fluorina-
ted polymer consisted of three-layer structure:
Fluorinated layer, unmodified layer (virgin lay-
er), and boundary layer (main chemical conver-
sion processes proceed inside that reaction zone).
Fig. 3 shows the SEM image of un-fluorinated and
fluorinated HDPE. However, the boundary layer
is very narrow, almost invisible, suggesting that
HDPE has the high crystal capability.
The SEM images show that the depth of
fluorinated layers has remarkable change under
the different fluorination time and the density of
fluorinate mixtures. Figs. 4(a,b) have the same
experiment conditions except that the fluorination
time of former is half of that of the latter. As ex-
pected, the longer the fluorination time is, the
higher the fluorine level is. The depth of fluorina-
ted layer in Fig. 4(a) is 5. 75 pm but in Fig. 4(b)
is 7. 86 um. The density of fluorinate mixture of
Fig. 5(a) is 1% more than that of Fig. 5(b). The
depth of fluorinated layer of Fig. 5(a) 《5. 46 pm)
is 0.39 pm thicker than that of Fig. 5(b) (5.07
pum), and there is similar tendency showed in
Fig. 4. However, their relationship is not linearity.
As summarized in Table 3 and showed in
Fig . 6 , the wetting behavior of the fluorinated

HDPE is observed by CA, and CA of water on
the surface of HDPE is measured before and after
the direct fluorination. The surface of HDPE be-
comes significantly more hydrophobic, as a result
of direct fluorination, as shown by the notable in-
crease of CA of water from 78. 5° to 90. 0°. At the
same time, CA increases from 90. 0° to 104. 5° as
the fluorination depth increases from 5.07 pm to
7.86 pm. This remarkable growth in the surface

Fig. 7 shows the relationship between the in-
crement rate of fluorinated and un-fluorinated
HDPE hollow spheres during 10 d. As previously
mentioned, the main difference observed between
the fluorinated and un-fluorinated HDPE is the
barrier property. The direct fluorination enhances
the surface barrier performance of HDPE. There-
fore, the increasing rate of Sample 1 (fluorinated
HDPE) is much lower than that of Sample 2 (un-
fluorinated HDPE),
un-fluorinated HDPE hollow spheres in water
Similar trend is obtained in Fig. 8. Fluorina-
ted HDPE hollow sphere forms a resistant surface
to oil according to the fluorination performance.
C—F bond has a higher barrier property of im-
hydrophobicity is due to the increasing F/C ratio
and the absence of hydrophilic ionic C—F bonds.
From CAs, the surface tension of direct fluorina-
ted HDPE sharply decreases from over 30 m 。
(1`擎m)_1 to 19 In 。 〈Nm)_1 after fluorination due
to the incorporation of fluorine. Fluorinated
HDPE layer indeed becomes similar to PTFE
which has a surface tension of 18.5 mm。 (Nm).

change for four samples immersed in water and
jet fuel during 10 d measurements, respectively.

penetrability in fuel, especially in jet fuel. The
increasing rate of un-fluorinated HDPE is higher
than that of the fluorinated one.
un-fluorinated HDPE hollow spheres in jet fuel
At the same time, Fig. 8 shows that the cure
in the initial two days is sharper than that in the
later days. The reason is that a multi-component
mixture such as jet fuel is quite different from a
pure liquid such as water. The evaporation of wa-
ter is a constant with respect to time. However,
the evaporation of jet fuel is not linear with time.
The permeability of a liquid consisting of a mix-
ture of hydrocarbons is very sensitive to incre-
ment of mass. With the light compounds are de-
creased, and the permeability of jet fuel is de-
creased, too.
3 CONCLUSION
Compared with the modified treatment of
surface property mentioned in the previous litera-
tures, the direct fluorination method applied in
HDPE is a more effective, simple and convenient
modified technology. The different depths of
fluorinated layers show that the fluorination level
is affected by the fluorination time and the density
of fluorinate mixtures. A higher CA obtained on
the surface of HDPE indicates that the direct
fluorination make it have lower surface energy
and more hydrophobic feature. Therefore, direct
fluorination decreases water and jet fuel permea-
ting through the surface of HDPE hollow
spheres.
