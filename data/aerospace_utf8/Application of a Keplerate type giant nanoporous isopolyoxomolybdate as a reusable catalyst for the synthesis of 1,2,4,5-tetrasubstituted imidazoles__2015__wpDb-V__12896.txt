The imidazole ring system is an important nitrogen-con-
number of natural products and pharmacologically active
have been reported to possess interesting biological properties,
and B-Raf kinase [19]. Furthermore, recent advances in green
via the four-component reaction of 1,2-diketones or a-hy-
droxyketones with aldehydes, primary amines, and ammonium
acetate in the presence of a catalyst such as L-proline [24],
[32], FeCls/montmorillonite K10 under microwave irradiation
{33]}, p-dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid [34], and montmorillonite
K10 supported titanium [35]. 1,2,4,5-Tetrasubstituted imidaz-
oles can also be accessed by the hetero-Cope rearrangement or
the N-alkylation of trisubstituted imidazoles [36,37]. However,
some ofthese synthetic methods have been limited in terms of
their application because of poor yields or their requirement
for expensive catalysts, long reaction time, and tedious isola-
method using an inexpensive catalyst with high catalytic activ-
ity for the synthesis of 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted imidazoles.
As a result of our interest in the synthesis of heterocyclic
compounds [38-41], and as part of our ongoing research to-
wards the development of environmentally friendly methods
for the synthesis of organic compounds using reusable catalysts
[42-48], we report herein the use of the Keplerate type giant
catalyst for the efficient solvent-free synthesis of 1,2,4,5-
tetrasubstituted imidazoles. This new process allows for the
one-pot synthesis of 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted imidazoles by the
that the clusters possessed a periodic structure with an average
diameter of approximately 3 nm. This experimentally deter-
mined diameter was in good agreement with the theoretical
value for the inner diameter of the ball-shaped POM [8,9].

stirred for 10 min, during which time it became blue-green in
color. The mixture was then treated with 50% CHsCOOH (83
ml} to give a green solution, which was stored in an open
500-ml Erlenmeyer flask at 20 °C without stirring. It is note-
worthy that the solution became dark brown in color on
washed sequentially with absolute ethanol and diethyl ether,
before being dried in air [8].

mmol), and {Mo132} (0.1 g) was heated in the oil bath at 140 °C
for 20-90 min. Upon completion of the reaction, as determined
by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), the mixture was diluted
with hot ethanol and then filtered to remove the catalyst. The
catalyst was then washed with a small portion of hot ethanol
(10 ml), and the combined filtrates were concentrated in vol-
by filtration, and recrystallized from ethanol to give com-
pounds Sa-5m in high yields (Scheme 1). The melting points
were recorded using a Stuart SMP3 melting point apparatus.
The FT-IR spectra of the products were recorded on a Tensor
27 Bruker spectrophotometer as KBr disks. The 1H NMR spec-
tra were recorded on Bruker 400 and 500 spectrometers at
400 and 500 MHz, respectively.

3.1. Characterized results of {Moi3z}
The {Mois2} catalyst was characterized by FT-IR, UV/Vis,
and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, as well as microa-
nalysis. The FT-IR spectrum of the catalyst is shown in Fig. 2(1)
and contains the characteristic vibrational bands of the Mo=0
bond at 969 and 936 cm-1, as well bands belonging to the COO-
and NH4a+ groups at 1544 and 1406 cm-l, respectively. The
FT-IR spectrum of the catalyst also contained bands at
2500-3600 and 1618 cm-!, which indicated the presence of
water. Pleasingly, the FT-IR spectrum of the {Mots2} catalyst
prepared in the current study was consistent with those re-
ported by Miiller’ [8] and Zhou’ [9] groups. The UV/Vis spec-
trum of the {Mots2} catalyst provided further confirmation of
its structure, and the characteristic absorption bonds at 213,
232, 265, and 447 nm were consistent with those reported in
the literature [8]. The XRD pattern of {[Molsz} catalyst (Fig. 3)

3.2. Evaluation of catalytic activity of {Mo13z} towards the
reaction
The catalytic activity of {Mo132} was evaluated in the syn-
thesis of 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted imidazoles. The synthesis of
compound 5b by the four-component reaction of benzil (1
mmol) with 4-chlorobenzaldehyde (1 mmol), aniline (1 mmol),
and ammonium acetate (1 mmol) was initially selected as a
model reaction to optimize the reaction conditions. Several
reaction parameters were evaluated during this optimization
stage, including the loading of the {Mo132} catalyst, the temper-
ature of the reaction, and the reaction solvent (Table 1). It is
clear from the results shown in Table 1 that the shortest reac-
tion time and best yield were achieved under solvent-free con-
ditions (Table 1, entry 14). These results also revealed that the
loading of the catalyst and the reaction temperature had a sig-
nificant impact on the yield of compound 5b when the reaction
was conducted under solvent-free conditions. For example, the
reaction gave a very low yield of the product when it was con-

ducted in the absence of the catalyst at 140 °C (Table 1, entry
of the catalyst at room temperature (Table 1, entry 2). These
results therefore highlighted the importance of the catalyst
loading and reaction temperature on the success of the reac-
tion. Increases in the amount of the catalyst and reaction tem-
perature up to 0.10 g and 140 °C, respectively, led to an in-

in these parameters did not lead to further improvements in

catalyzed the condensation reactions of 1, 2, 3, and 4 to give
the desired products 5a-5m in high yields over relatively short
reaction time. It is noteworthy that the products could be read-
ily separated from the catalyst, making this method especially
useful for the synthesis of a wide range of 1,2,4,5-tetrasubsti-
tuted imidazoles.
catalyst were compared with those previously reported for the
synthesis of 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted imidazoles using a variety
of different catalysts (Table 3). The results of this comparison
revealed that the {Mois} catalyst gave shorter reaction time
than all of the other conditions [except for the reaction cata-
lyzed by FeCla/montmorillonite K10 under microwave irradia-
tion), as well as higher yields of the desired products.
The reusability of the catalyst {Moi32} was also evaluated
under the optimized reaction conditions. Upon completion of
the reaction, the catalyst was recovered according to the pro-
cedure described in the experimental section. The recovered
catalyst was washed with hot ethanol and then dried under
vacuum at 50 °C for 1 h before being reused in the same reac-
tion. The results of this reusability study revealed that the cat-
alyst could be used at least four times with only a slight reduc-
tion in its activity (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the FT-IR spectra of the
recovered catalyst (Fig. 2(2)-(4)) were almost identical to that
of the fresh catalyst (Fig. 2(1)), which indicated that the struc-
ture of the catalyst was unchanged by the reaction.
A plausible mechanism for the {Mots2}-catalyzed formation
ofthe 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted imidazoles is shown in Scheme 2.
The {Mo132} catalyst has several accessible Mo sites and NHa
groups, which could act as Lewis acid and Bronsted acid cen-
ters, respectively, and therefore promote the reaction. The cat-
alyst would play a significant role in increasing the electrophilic
character of the electrophiles in the reaction. Ammonia could
be released from the ammonium acetate in the reaction which
could be detected using a pH indicator. When a piece of pH
paper was held above the reaction mixture, a blue coloration
was observed. This result indicated that the reaction proceeded
by the initial nucleophilic attack of ammonia and the primary
amine on the carbonyl group of the {Moisz}-activated aldehyde
with concomitant dehydration to give intermediate I. Interme-
diate I would then react with [Mois2}-activated benzil to afford
intermediate II, which would be converted to intermediate II
through a dehydration reaction. Finally, the dehydration of
intermediate III would give the 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted imid-
azole product. According to this mechanism, the {Motsz} cata-
lyst would facilitate the formation of intermediates I, Il, and IIL
Several attempts were made to isolate these intermediates
under the optimized conditions, but all of these efforts were
unsuccessful.
4, Conclusions
In conclusion, we have used the Keplerate-type giant na-
noporous isopolyoxomolybdate {Mo132} as an efficiently cata-
lyst for the synthesis of 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted imidazoles in
the one-pot, four-component reaction of benzil with an aro-
matic aldehyde, primary amine, and ammonium acetate under
solvent-free conditions. This method provided the desired
products in high yields over short reaction time, following a
facile work-up process. Furthermore, the catalyst could be
readily recycled, and reused at least three times without any
discernible reduction in its catalytic activity. The procedure is
also advantageous in the sense that it is a solvent-free reaction
and therefore operates under environmentally friendly condi-
tions.
