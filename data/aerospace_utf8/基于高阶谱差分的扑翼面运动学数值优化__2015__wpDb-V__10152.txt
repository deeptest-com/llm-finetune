In the last three decades, there has been a continuous
geometry and/or kinematics to achieve the optimal aero-
dynamic performance in terms of lift, lift to drag ratio,
thrust, propulsive efficiency, power consumption, etc. ,
with different level of fidelity. Early in 1980s, Jones 21
had calculated the optimum load distribution along the
wing for a given wing-root bending moment during the
pure flapping motion based on classic aerodynamic the-
ories. They found that the optimum loading was able to
generate thrust more efficiently compared with an elliptic
loading, which was suggested to be optimal for steady
flight. After that, numerical optimization based on low
fidelity aerodynamic models is carried out to optimize the
hovering or forward flapping flight. Most of these studies
adopted blade element momentum (BEM) theories’ "4!
or vortex lattice methods’ to model aerodynamic
loadings. A trade-off of these low fidelity aerodynamic
models is the low computational cost. Although these
researches have made substantial progress in optimal
flapping flight, low fidelity aerodynamic models may fail
to provide appropriate level of complexity of the flow
information when viscous effects became non-negligible!”
or the 3D nonlinear effects dominate the flow fields? 。
The growing sophistication of computational hardware
and simulation tools now allows for the direct coupling
between optimization algorithms and high-fidelity Navier-
Stokes solvers for the purpose of flapping motion optimi-
zation, Tuncer and Kaya[2“ optimized the weighted sum
consisting of thrust and propulsive efficiency of a flap-
ping airfoil in combined plunging and pitching motion by
coupling a gradient-based optimization method with a 2D
Navier-Stokes solver supporting moving overset grids.
Willis et alL. 00 exploited a collection of computational
tools with multiple fidelity levels in the design of effective
flapping wing vehicles. In 2009, Pesavento and
Wang[21 further confirmed that 2D flapping flight can be
aerodynamically more efficient than the optimal steady
motion. Recently, Culbreth et al. [2] presented several
optimization results for flapping airfoils and wings obtained
from an optimization framework constructed by a gradient-
based optimization algorithm and a low-dissipation kinetic
energy preserving ( KEP) finite volume Navier-Stokes
solver. They found that the maximum propulsive

performed shape and kinematics optimization of flapping
wings for maximum propulsive efficiency using the 3D
unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes simulation. Tt
is found that the combined optimization of wing shape
and kinematics can significantly improve the performance
of thrust and propulsive efficiency.
In the present study, we focus on maximizing
endurance time for long-duration cruising flight. Therefore,
the propulsive efficiency is chosen as the objective
function. Optimization studies!’ ">?! for forward
flight have been carried out with the vortex lattice method
or low-order ( <2) CFD methods. Considering that
flapping wing aerodynamics features vortex-dominated
flow, we propose to take a high-order accurate CFD
method based cost-effective high-fidelity optimization
approach to provide further insights into flapping motions
with maximum propulsive efficiency. At the first stage,
a gradient-based optimization algorithm is coupled with a
high-order spectral difference (SD) Navier-Stokes solver
to search for the optimal kinematics on a’ coarse mesh.
Then a high-order SD Navier-Stokes solver is used to
simulate the flow fields with the optimized flapping kine-
matics on a fine mesh. Note that grid and polynomial
order refinement studies are performed to make sure that
the optimal kinematics obtained on the coarse mesh is
still optimal on the fine mesh. Results from the refine-
ment study will be presented in Section 2. Simulations on
fine meshes can better resolve the detailed vortex structures
associated with the optimal kinematics and help understand
flow physics.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
In Section 1, the optimization framework including the
numerical method is introduced. Numerical results are
displayed and discussed in Section 2. Section 3 briefly
concludes the present work and points out possible
future work.
1 Optimization framework
1.1 Governing equations
Numerical simulations are performed with an un-
steady compressible Navier-Stokes solver using dynamic
form read ,
where Q=(p,pu,pv,E) T are the conserved variables,
and F,G are the total fluxes including both the inviscid
and viscous flux vectors, i.e., 万 = 上 -F“ and G=G'-

shown above, the Jacobian matrix J takes the following
form

The SD method is used for the space discretization.
In the SD method, two sets of points are given, namely
the solution and flux points, as shown in Fig. 1(b).
Conservative variables are defined at the solution points
(SPs), and then interpolated to flux points to calculate
local fluxes. In the present study, the solution points
are chosen as the Chebyshev-Gauss quadrature points
and the flux points are selected to be the Legendre-
Gauss points with end points as -1 and 1. Then using
common inviscid flux on the interface. The reconstruction
_ of the common viscous flux is based on the average of the
more detailed implementation procedures.
1.3 Simulation parameters
In this study, the kinematics of the airfoil is specified
as follows:
Plunging motion: y = hsin( wt) ;
Pitching motion; 8 = Asin( wt + ￠)
where y and 6 are the plunging displacement and pitching
angle of the airfoil respectively,〖 and A are the plunging
and pitching amplitude respectively, w is the angular
frequency of the oscillation and ￠ is the phase lag
between the plunging and pitching motions.
The aerodynamic parameters are specified as follows.
The Reynolds number (Re) based on the airfoil chord
length and the free stream velocity is defined as Re =
pU, C/u, well within the insect flight regime. The
Strouhal number Sir based on the plunging amplitude h
is defined as Str = 2fh/U, , where 卜 = wx/(2r is the
oscillating frequency. The reduced frequency k based on
the airfoil chord length C is defined as k= 2wfC/U,.
The free stream Mach number ( Ma) in this study is
fixed at Ma =0.1. The AUSM「-up approximate Riemann
solver for all speeds'”? is used to resolve the low Mach
number flow.
1.4 Optimization procedure
For simplicity,we consider an unconstrained opti-
mization problem of the form
where ],wor is the propulsive efficiency, (C,) is
the time averaged thrust coefficient, (C,,,.,) is the time
averaged power coefficient of the oscillating airfoil, and x
denotes the optimization parameters. For 2D simulations,
the time averaged thrust coefficient (C,) is defined as

optimization steps are smaller than 10”, then the optimi-
zation process will stop and the current optimization
parameters are deemed as optimal.
2 Optimization results and discussions
Optimization variables are flapping kinematics
parameters, including the phase shift between plunge and
pitch motions ￠, the pitch and plunge amplitudes h h
and the oscillation angular frequency w. Since the
aerodynamic performance can vary significantly with airfoils
thickness「“「201 | three NACA 4-digit airfoils, namely,
NACA0006,NACA0012 and NACA0030,in combined
plunge and pitch motion are used to test the effects of
airfoil thickness on optimal flapping kinematics. The
effects of Reynolds number and pitching pivot location
on optimal flapping kinematics are also presented in this
section.
2. 1 Numerical verification
First of all, the optimization framework is verified
using the NACA0012 airfoil. The optimization parameter
is the phase shift between plunge and pitch motions ￠.
Initially, ￠ is set as 70°. Other parameters are specified
as Str=0.3, k=1.0, A=20° and Re=1,200. Both h-
refinement (grid refinement) and p-refinement ( polynomial
degree) studies are carried out to determine the suitable
grid and scheme accuracy. The results are displayed in
Table 1. For the coarse mesh, 34 elements are placed on
the airfoil surface and 23 elements are assigned in the
radial direction from the airfoil. For the medium mesh .
the element number in the radial direction is kept the
same as that for the coarse mesh ,while the element
number in the circumferential direction ( along the airfoil
surface) is 70 elements. For the fine mesh, the element
number in the circumferential direction is 100 ,and that
in the radial direction is 35. The minimum cell size
normalized by the airfoil chord length in the radial direction
is 0. 001 for all cases,which has been demonstrated
(i.e., n and ￠) using P’ reconstruction on the coarse
mesh agree well with those using P’ reconstruction on
both the coarse and medium meshes. The results using
P' reconstruction are converging towards those values.
To save computational cost,P7“ reconstruction on the
coarse mesh is used in all optimization simulations. A
thorough verification of the current Navier-Stokes flow
solver for unsteady flapping wing aerodynamics simulations
can be found in Ref. [25, 27].

The convergence histories of the L, norm of Vg
and ￠ using P? reconstruction on the coarse grid are
shown in Fig. 2. We observe that the optimal propulsive
efficiency is achieved after only six optimization iterations.

Since the gradient-based optimization algorithm is
used to search for the local extrema, initial guess needs
to be sufficiently close to the optimal point to ensure a
solution. Thus, the initial guess must be based on the flow
physics of flapping flight. In this paper, initial values of
the optimization variables are chosen based on the previous
stu(i}′[z7〕. After optimization, in order to elucidate the
detailed vortical structures under the optimal airfoil
oscillation, flow fields associated with the optimized
kinematics are simulated using a 3“ order accurate SD
scheme on the fine mesh.
2.2.1 Effects of airfoil thickness
The optimization results of flapping kinematics for
NACA0006,NACA0012 and NACA0030 airfoils are
presented in Table 2. The Reynolds number is chosen as
1,200, and the pitch pivot is located at C/3 from the
leading edge of the airfoil. From this table, it is found
that the optimized flapping kinematics and propulsive
efficiency for _NACA0006 and NACA0012 are very
similar. For both airfoils, the propulsive efficiency is
larger than 50% . The maximum propulsive efficiency
for the oscillating NACA0030 airfoil is about 32% ,and
the optimized flapping kinematics is very different from
that of NACA0006 and NACAOO12. These results indicate
that airfoil thickness has large influence on the optimal
flapping kinematics, and relatively thin airfoils have more
potential to acquire superior aerodynamic performance.
This trend agrees well with the observation from previous
studies"?!

quickly shed from the airfoil and the flow then attaches
to the airfoil surface again. During most of the
oscillation cycle, no leading edge separation shows up.
These flow features may be critical for maintaining high

observe that the flow fields for NACA0006 and NACA0012

airfoils are very similar. The separation region on the
NACA0030 airfoil at phases w/2 and 3%/2 is much
larger than that on the thin airfoils. This will affect the
aerodynamic force generation.
The time histories of the thrust and lift force coefficients
for all three airfoils are compared in Fig. 6. From the
results it is observed that both the thrust and lift force
histories of NACA0006 and NACA0012 airfoils are verv
similar, while that of the NACA0030 airfoil exhibits
larger peaks. Especially for the lift force history, the
peak lift value on NACA0030 near the phases n/2 and
31/2 is more than twice of that on both NACAO0006 and
NACA0012. This corresponds well with the flow fields
discussed previously.
Furthermore,these phenomena explain why the
optimized propulsive efficiencies for NACA0006 and
shown in Table 2. Specifically, according to the definition
of the propulsive efficiency 7, if the thrust coefficient
《Cr〉is similar, then the propulsive efficiency is deter-
mined by the input power (C,,,.). If we assume that
the mass and moment of inertia of the airfoil can be
neglected (i. e. no inertia), then the input power is
actually the work done by the lift force and the aerodynamic
moment per unit time. It has been examined that the
work done by the aerodynamic moment is much smaller
than that done by the lift force. Therefore, it is clear
propulsive efficiency. The large lift generation on the
NACA0030 airfoil results in inferior propulsion
performance.

2.2.2 Effects of Revnolds number
The optimization results of flapping kinematics for
NACA0012 under different Reynolds numbers are
presented in Table 3. The pitch pivot is located at from
the leading edge of the airfoil. Several observations are
concluded from this table. First of all, larger propulsive
efficiency is obtained as the Reynolds number increases.
According to Anderson et al. 2 the propulsive efficiency
of an oscillating NACA0012 airfoil can reach as high as
87% in the Strouhal number range 0.3 ~ 0. 4 at Re =
40, 000. In this study, the maximum propulsive
efficiency of the NACA0012 airfoil at Re = 1,200 is
achieved at Str = 0. 42 with a value of 53. 4%. The
relatively low propulsive efficiency is probably due to the
optimal Strouhal number range 0. 25 ~ 0. 35 reported
in[21、This is due to that the analysis in[21 is based on
high Reynolds number flow. Current results show
similarity with the literature reported for low Reynolds
number range (e.g. , 100) (343

symmetric vortex patterns will show up for phases r and
3m/2 as illustrated in Fig. 3 ~ Fig. 53 only the vorticity
fields at the first two phases are presented. Similarly as
in the cases for different thicknesses, no leading edge
separation shows up during most of the oscillation cycle ;
large scale leading edge separation only occurs when the
airfoil starts to reverse its plunging direction.

detailed vortical structures at Re = 300 are quite different
from those at Re=600 and Re = 1 ,200 as shown in Fig. 4

2.2.3 Effects of pivot location
The optimization results of flapping kinematics with
different pitching pivot locations are presented in Table
4. Three frequently adopted pivot locations, in previous
C/3 and C/2, are used in this section. The NACA0012
airfoil is adopted in this section ,and the Reynolds
number is fixed at 1,200. The vorticity fields around the
oscillating NACAQD12 airfoil with the optimized kinematics at
the first two phases, namely, 0 and m/2, for both
are compared in Fig. 10. From Table 4 and Fig. 10, it is

found that the optimized flapping kinematics and the
aerodynamic performance for all these cases are very
similar. From Fig. 9, it is observed that although the
aredynamic performance of the cases with different
pitching pivot locations is similar,the detailed vortical
structures with pitching pivot located at C/4 are apparently
ditferent from those with pitching pivot located at C/3
and C/2. Based on all the results, we conclude that the
locations of the three frequently adopted pitching pivots
pitching pivot do not significantly affect the kinematics
optimization.
2.3 Discussion of the optimized kinematics
In this section, aerodynamic performance and the
corresponding flow fields from the optimized and non-
optimized cases around an oscillating NACA0006 airfoil
are compared. From Table 5, it is clear that although
the time averaged thrust coefficient is almost the same
for these two cases, the propulsive efficiency for the
optimized case is about 2. 5 times of that for the non-
optimized case. The time histories of the thrust and lift
force coefficients with optimized and non-optimized
kinematics for a NACA0006 airfoil with Re = 1 ,200 and
the pitch pivot located at C/3 are presented in Fig. 11.
The vorticity fields with the non-optimized kinematics
parameters at four phases are displayed in Fig. 12. It is
obvious that large leading edge separation appears during
the entire oscillation cycle. Also observed from Table 5 ,
there exists apparent difference on the pitching
amplitude between the optimized and non-optimized
cases. This infers that the large leading edge separation
from the non-optimized case could be connected with the
variation of the effective angle of attack (404) .

plunge and pitch motion is given as

of large leading edge separation. However for the non-
optimized case, the peak absolute value of effective AOA
can reach about 40° and during the entire oscillation
cycle, the effective AOA remains at large value. Then a
large leading edge separation appears during the entire
oscillation cycle for the non-optimized case.

FHig.14 Effective angle of attack
The variation of the effective AOA for different airfoils,
Reynolds numbers and pivot locations with optimized
kinematics parameters is shown in Fig. 13(b) ~ Fig. 13
(d). For the airfoil thickness tests, it is clear that the
variation trend for both NACA0006 and NACA0012 is
quite similar, but different from that for NACA0030. It
is also found that the peak absolute value of effective
AOA of NACA0030 is about 30°, which is twice that of
the other two airfoils. Thus the lift generation on
NACA0030 can be much larger than that on NACA0006
and NACA0012. Based on the analyses in Section 2.2.1,
the lower optimized propulsive efficiency of NACA0030
can be attributed to the large variation of the effective
AOA. For both the Reynolds number and pitching pivot
location tests, it is found that the peak absolute values of
effective AOA are well controlled below 20° for all these
cases.
3 Conclusions and future work
A high-order SD method based numerical optimization
gradient-based optimization algorithm is coupled with a
high-order SD Navier-Stokes solver to search for the
optimal kinematics for a certain airfoil undergoing
combined plunging and pitching motion on a coarse
mesh. Specifically, the quasi-Newton optimization
algorithm BFGS is used to speed up the convergence.
Then the high-order SD scheme is used to simulate the
detailed vortex structures associated with the optimal
kinematics of the flapping flight on a fine mesh.
The proposed optimization procedure isused to optimize
several flapping kinematics, including the oscillation
frequency ,plunging and pitching amplitudes and the
phase lag between the plunging and pitching motion.
The effects of airfoil thickness, Reynolds number, and
pivot location on the optimization output are investigated.
It is found that the maximum propulsive efficiency for
NACA0006 and NACA0012 airfoils is more than 50%
after four kinematics parameters are optimized. However,
the optimized propulsive efficiency for a NACA0030
airfoil can only reach about 30%. As Reynolds numbers
increase, the propulsive efficiency becomes larger. It is also
found that locations of pitching pivot do not significantly
affect the kinematics optimization. Based on the comparison
between optimized and non-optimized cases for the
NACA0006 airfoil, it is found that the variation of effective
AOA plays a key role in achieving high propulsive efficiency.
Specifically, under optimized conditions, the variation of
effective AOA is well controlled to avoid the occurrence
of large leading edge separation during most of the
oscillation cycle.
We note that this work is a first attempt to incorporate
high-order accurate numerical schemes into the optimization
framework for unsteady vortex-dominated flow. In future
work, more sophisticated flapping flight conditions will
be considered, such as including the constraints of lift
and power. In order to extend the current work for
efficient 3D optimization of both kinematics and geometry,
an adjoint-based numerical optimization framework
needs to be established. These issues are reserved for
future publications.
